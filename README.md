## Project Tasks

### 1. Handling Missing Data

Inspecting the dataset for any missing values and determine the most suitable strategy for handling them. This might involve filling in missing values with appropriate alternatives or removing records with missing data, depending on the situation.

### 2. Clubbing Columns

Simplifying the dataset by combining categories within columns, where applicable. This step can streamline your analysis and help in drawing more accurate conclusions.

### 3. Outlier Detection and Removal

Identifying potential outliers in the dataset that could skew your analysis. Deciding on the appropriate approach for dealing with these outliers, whether it's removing them, replacing them with more representative values, or leaving them as they are.

### 4. Data Summary

After cleaning and preparing the data, summarizing the findings. Calculating relevant statistical measures such as averages, medians, and other metrics. Utilizing visualizations such as charts and graphs to enhance the understanding of the data.
